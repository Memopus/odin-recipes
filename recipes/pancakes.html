    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These vegan pancakes are light, fluffy, and delicious. I have been making
      them for years, and everyone that tries them wants the recipe.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl; make a
        well in the center. Whisk together water and oil in a small bowl; pour
        into flour mixture. Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy.
      </li>
      <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>
        Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form
        and edges are dry. Flip, then cook until bottoms are browned, 1 to 2
        minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
      </li>
    </ol>
