    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
      <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
        about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped
        onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced
        garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1
        minute more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat
        through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add
        beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork,
        until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss
        again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are
        very salty).
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan
        cheese at the table.
      </li>
    </ol>
